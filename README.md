# Project Mash

A website to show the most common key mashes in Google Searches.

This site hosted at [mash.kleinsoft.co.nz](http://mash.kleinsoft.co.nz) will one day have billions of search results on Google, 
For now, Google will index our website, which has no cap on the pages.

## Goals

Our main goal for Project Mash is to have our website come up under every single Google search.

Our secondary goal is to collect data on which pages are visited the most and to create a heat map of the most pressed keys in a mash.


## Contributing

While this is not a dictionary, we have a facts system. This is the part where the hashes shows up.
If you have a fun fact about some mash Contribute it! Write out a rule in the `facts/rules.grl` file and submit it.
